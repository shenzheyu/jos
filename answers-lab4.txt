1.
MPBOOTPHYS translates the kernel virtual address to physical address.

2.
If multiple CPU run the kernel mode simutaneously, the later will overwrite the former.

3.
Because kern_pgdir is the template of env_pgdir, the two virtual addresses of e has the same physical address mapping.

4.
Because address translation happens when user application traps into kernel. In trap() of kern/trap.c, it stores the tf into env.
